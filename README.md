Responsive Flex & Grid Layout
This project demonstrates a simple, responsive web page layout using modern CSS technologies: Flexbox and CSS Grid. The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Features
Responsive Design: The layout automatically adjusts for different screen widths using media queries.

Flexbox: The "Flexbox Section" uses flexbox to create a row of items that wrap to the next line when the screen is too narrow. On mobile, the items stack vertically.

CSS Grid: The "Grid Section" uses CSS Grid to create a multi-column layout. The number of columns changes from three on a desktop to two on a tablet, and finally to a single column on a mobile device.

Custom Styling: The project uses CSS variables to define a consistent color palette and modern styling.

How to Run the Code
To view this project, you only need to open the index.html file in any modern web browser. The CSS is linked directly from the HTML, so no server is required.

Save the provided HTML and CSS code in two separate files: index.html and style.css.

Ensure both files are in the same folder.

Double-click index.html to open it in your browser.

File Structure
The project consists of two files:

index.html: Contains the main HTML structure of the web page. It includes a header, a main content area with Flexbox and Grid sections, and a footer.

style.css: Contains all the CSS for styling the page and implementing the responsive layout. This file includes media queries to handle different screen sizes.
